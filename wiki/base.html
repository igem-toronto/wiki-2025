  "/": "Welcome to iGEM 2025! Your team has been approved and you are ready to start the iGEM season!",
  "/attributions": "Accurate attribution is essential in the iGEM Competition. It ensures that the judges can properly assess your team's contributions and recognize the support provided by external collaborators. This page is dedicated to fulfilling the Attributions requirement for judging.",
  "/contribution": "Make a useful contribution for future iGEM teams and document it on this page.",
  "/description": "Describe how and why you chose your iGEM project.",
  "/education": "Innovative educational tools and outreach activities have the ability to establish a two-way dialogue with new communities by discussing public values and the science behind synthetic biology.",
  "/engineering": "Demonstrate engineering success in a technical aspect of your project by going through at least one iteration of the engineering design cycle.",
  "/entrepreneurship": "The entrepreneurship prize recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project.",
  "/experiments": "Describe the research, experiments, and protocols you used in your project. It is designed to provide sufficient information for other teams to replicate our work.",
  "/hardware": "Hardware in iGEM should make synthetic biology based on standard parts easier, faster, better, or more accessible to our community.",
  "/human-practices": "We ask every team to think deeply and creatively about whether their project is responsible and good for the world. Consider how the world affects your work and how your work affects the world.",
  "/inclusivity": "The Inclusivity Award recognizes exceptional efforts to include people with diverse identities in scientific research. Who is allowed to have a voice in iGEM, synthetic biology, and science more broadly? How have you developed new opportunities to eliminate barriers and allow more people to contribute to, participate in, and/or be represented by these communities? To compete for this prize, activities do not have to be directly related to your teamâ€™s project. Document your approach, how you improved inclusivity, and what was learned.",
  "/measurement": "Synthetic Biology needs great measurement approaches for characterizing parts, and efficient new methods for characterizing many parts at once. Describe your measurement approaches on this page.",
  "/members": "This page is dedicated to introducing the individuals who made our iGEM project possible. Here, you'll find information about our team members, instructors, and advisors.",

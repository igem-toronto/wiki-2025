For potential investors, we provide a concise executive summary outlining our problem statement, market opportunity, and value proposition. Our work is strengthened under the mentorship of individuals from leading academic institutions, whose ongoing research and collaboration enhance our scientific foundation and accelerate our innovation pipeline. Additionally, our thorough evaluation assesses the beneficial and detrimental long-term impacts of our business to provide a holistic perspective on Mystiphage as an industry leader.

  

## iGEM Entrepreneurship Criteria

This section outlines the criteria we followed for the iGEM entrepreneurship component. While this provides a high-level overview of our approach, we recommend reviewing all deliverables for comprehensive details.

### Have we identified our target customers and unmet market needs that existing solutions fail to address?

We have identified potential customers across multiple market tiers. Tier 1 customers include clinical phage laboratories such as Davidson Lab and Maxwell Lab at the University of Toronto, plus prospects at UC San Diego's IPATH center and Georgia’s Eliava Institute. We have also identified strategic opportunities with biotech startups like BiomX, SNIPIR Biome, and Phiogen that currently lack internal AI capabilities. Additionally, our team has focused on critical unmet needs that existing solutions fail to address. The phage matching process currently takes a median of 171 days, with only 9.4% of requests resulting in treatment at Belgium's Queen Astrid Military Hospital. Major gaps include a lack of centralized phage libraries, unavailable lytic phages for specific pathogens, coordination delays between laboratories, and unstandardized screening protocols. Our stakeholder validation from leading phage research centers, including Eliava Institute and Queen Astrid Phage Center, confirmed strong market demand. No existing solution combines generative AI-powered receptor-binding protein design with wet-lab validation, positioning us to uniquely reduce development timelines from six months to hours.

#### Has the team shown that their solution is possible, scalable, and inventive?


Through our wetlab and drylab validation cycle, we have proven that our proprietary pipeline, which includes our generative model PHORAGER, can generate feasible results and validate them for biological function. Our solution becomes increasingly scalable through a generative RBP bank - a library of validated designs that can be recombined for future clinical needs. In vitro results fine-tune our models, lessening wet lab validation requirements over time as the AI learns from each successful design. Our dual-layer platform combines predictive bioinformatics with generative protein models to create receptor-binding proteins that enable phages to bind specific bacterial targets, reducing design time from months to hours. Academic literature and our interviews with academic stakeholders confirmed that our AI-driven phage sequence modification, alongside protein interaction validation, is a new arena in synthetic biology, especially phage therapy. We aim to be at the forefront of combining generative AI-powered receptor-binding protein design with wet-lab validation, enabling rapid custom phage design even when no natural match exists.

#### Do we have a comprehensive product development plan with realistic milestones, timelines, resource requirements, and risk assessments?

##### Structured Timeline and Milestones
Our development follows a structured 12-year timeline with three distinct phases. Phase 1 focuses on building the alpha AI platform, securing biobank access, and establishing wet-lab protocols. Phase 2 advances to beta launch, seed funding, and initial customer agreements. By Phase 3, we target commercial rollout in compassionate-use countries with established regulatory partnerships. Key milestones include Q1-Q2 Year 1 core AI model training on E. coli phage-host datasets, Q2-Q3 wet lab pipeline setup, Q3 biobank agreements, and Q4 provisional patent filing. This progression demonstrates logical sequencing from technical development through regulatory preparation to market entry.

##### Resource Requirements and Allocation
Our resource requirements include phage-bacteria interaction datasets from Davidson and Maxwell Labs, cloud GPU access through AWS, University of Toronto BioZone lab space, and IP strategy support from The Hatchery accelerator. Year 1 upfront costs total approximately CAD 305,900-328,950, covering lab equipment (CAD 8,200), documentation costs (CAD 80,000), and operational expenses.

##### Financial Projections and Revenue Model
Under the base case scenario, our hybrid revenue model charges a fixed base price of $5K-$8K per validated RBP, with compassionate-use cases often requiring 3-5 RBPs per patient, resulting in $15,000-$40,000 per purchase. In addition, we secure an 8% royalty on net revenue from phages in breakthrough therapies that are built using Mystiphage-designed RBPs.

##### Competitor Analysis 
Aside from companies working purely on phage therapy, there are also a couple of companies who are closer to Mystiphage in its AI-driven approach to targeting antibacterial resistance, here we analyze a few of these key competitors: 

1. PhageAI (Poland): PhageAI offers an AI-powered platform for in silico characterization of bacteriophages. Their technology reduces the time required to analyze phage genomes from several days to under an hour, facilitating rapid identification of suitable phages for therapeutic applications.
2. Locus Biosciences (USA): Locus Biosciences employs machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on phage-bacteria interactions. This approach enables the prediction of effective phage cocktails, enhancing the development of CRISPR-enhanced bacteriophage therapies. 
3. PrecisionPhage (Finland): PrecisionPhage has developed "Phagenomics," a browser-based tool that streamlines phage genome analysis. This platform aids in the rapid assembly and annotation of phage genomes, expediting the discovery of therapeutic phages.

Summary: Despite the competitors in the field, nobody currently has a reliable model for phage therapy (since no company can target the LPS bush accurately yet). Mystiphage, unlike many of these competitors, does not make a single protein. Instead, we are orchestrating a protein system to work by ensuring the phage binds to the bacteria. We don't want to generate single proteins; we want to design orchestrated protein systems. Hence, our advantage will be in the library of RBPs we create for customers to use.

#### Does the team have the necessary skills, capabilities, and stakeholder relationships to execute their solution 

##### Core Team Skills and Expansion Plans
Our founding team brings expertise in research development, operations oversight, business strategy, ethics, finance, and scientific translation. However, we have identified critical gaps requiring additional talent in AI and computational biology for proof of concept development, plus wet-lab operations for RBP validation and therapeutic testing. Following seed funding, we plan strategic personnel expansion across four key roles: AI Specialists (2 positions at CAD 70K-90K full-time), Operations Manager/Finance (CAD 60K-80K), Wet-Lab Technicians (4 positions at CAD 45K-60K each), and Marketing Development Lead (CAD 60K-85K). This hiring plan directly addresses our SWOT-identified weakness of limited AI expertise.

##### Critical Academic and Institutional Partnerships
We have secured strategic mentorships with researchers from Canada's leading phage research groups - Davidson Lab and Maxwell Lab at the University of Toronto - providing curated datasets, experimental advice, and scientific credibility. University of Toronto's BioZone facility offers physical lab space, safety infrastructure, and shared equipment access. The Hatchery accelerator provides business mentorship, IP strategy support, and investor connections.

##### Essential Resource Infrastructure
Our technical infrastructure encompasses comprehensive phage-bacteria interaction datasets sourced from partner laboratories, cloud-based GPU access through AWS for future sponsorship initiatives, BSL-2 wet laboratory facilities (CAD 4,000-7,000/month), and advanced protein modelling platforms including ESM-3 and Boltz-2. We have established a robust intellectual property strategy supported through The Hatchery, with specialized legal counsel engaged to facilitate patent filing processes. Our strategic partnership objectives encompass collaborative initiatives with established biotechnology companies, including IPATH, Eligo Biosciences, and Eliava Institute. These partnerships are designed to accelerate research workflows and facilitate the transition of phage therapy innovations toward pharmaceutical adoption and clinical implementation.

#### Has the team considered the positive and negative long-term impacts of their fully developed solution?

Our platform addresses antimicrobial resistance projected to cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050. By reducing phage therapy development from six months to hours, we democratize access to personalized treatments and transform phage therapy from a last resort to a frontline defence. Our modular RBP bank creates reusable therapeutic libraries that improve global health equity.

We identified critical challenges, including bacterial evolution and resistance development, making long-term efficacy unpredictable. Regulatory uncertainty surrounding genetically modified phages creates market barriers. Healthcare provider resistance to AI-based approaches may slow adoption. High computational costs ($5,000-$8,000 per therapeutic candidate) could limit accessibility despite democratization goals. Integration challenges into existing clinical workflows require substantial training and infrastructure adaptation. Intellectual property vulnerabilities exist since naturally occurring phages are difficult to patent. Using artificial intelligence to design genetic codes raises definite concerns about affecting evolution and potentially contributing to natural selection pressures. We acknowledge increasing regulatory pressure on AI data collection, utilization, and generation. Identified risks include bacterial resistance evolution, regulatory uncertainty for genetically modified phages, high costs, and clinical integration challenges.

We view artificial intelligence as a neutral tool that can be a public good or be detrimental to the well-being of humanity, depending heavily on the intentions. Given that many industries are transitioning for the better using artificial intelligence and that antibiotic resistance is an imminent danger to humanity, we consider AI-driven therapeutic development an inevitable advancement to save millions of lives.

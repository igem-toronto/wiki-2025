# Entrepreneurship 
Welcome to the iGEM Toronto Entrepreneurship team's wiki page!
We are here to tell you about a startup that will change the field.
We are here to tell you about Mystiphage. 

Founded in the heart of Toronto, our iGEM team has brought together
talented biologists, engineers, computer scientists, and entrepreneurs
to form a groundbreaking startup with a singular vision: to revolutionize
phage therapy. We launched our entrepreneurship journey from the University
of Toronto’s Hatchery NEST incubator and achieved “Go-To-Market” status
within six months. With mentorship from Canadian venture capitalists, founders,
and AI experts, we crafted a comprehensive 12-year business plan to guide
our long-term growth. Through extensive market research and collaboration
with academic, clinical, and industry stakeholders, we’ve refined our
competitive edge and ensured our solutions meet market needs. Looking ahead,
our team has plans to expand our pipeline by diversifying into
electropharmaceuticals for phage delivery. Our bold ambition reflects our
commitment to staying ahead of evolving infectious threats and building a
future-ready platform for personalized medicine.

Here, you’ll find a detailed look into our comprehensive business plan,
showcasing the feasibility, scalability, and innovation behind our approach
to personalized phage therapy. The plan includes a transparent product
development timeline, resource requirements, risk assessments, and a clear
roadmap to commercialization. For potential investors, we also offer a concise
one-pager that outlines our problem statement, market opportunity, and business
model. Our work is supported by a network of leading academic institutions found
below, whose research and collaboration continue to strengthen our scientific
foundation and accelerate our innovative pipeline.

## iGEM Entrepreneurship Criteria
For your convenience, we've summarized our work within iGEM's entrepreneurship
criteria. However, we strongly recommend reviewing all of our deliverables for
a holistic review.

### Has the team discovered their first potential customers and identified any unmet needs not yet covered by other existing solutions?

We have successfully identified our first potential customers across multiple tiers.
Our Tier 1 customers include clinical phage laboratories like Davidson Lab and
Maxwell Lab at University of Toronto, plus prospects at UC San Diego's IPATH center
and UHN/Sinai Health hospitals. We've also mapped strategic opportunities with
biotech startups including BiomX, SNIPR Biome, and Phiogen that lack internal AI
capabilities.

We identified critical unmet needs that existing solutions fail to address. The
phage matching process currently takes a median of 171 days, with only 9.4% of
requests resulting in treatment at Belgium's Queen Astrid Military Hospital.
Major gaps include lack of centralized phage libraries, unavailable lytic phages
for specific pathogens, coordination delays between laboratories, and
unstandardized screening protocols.

Our stakeholder validation from leading phage research centers including
Eliava Institute and Queen Astrid Phage Center confirmed strong market demand.
No existing solution combines generative AI-powered receptor-binding protein design
with wet-lab validation, positioning us to uniquely reduce development timelines
from six months to hours.

### Has the team shown that their solution is possible, scalable, and inventive?

Through our wet-lab and dry-lab validation cycle, we've proven our AI models
can generate functional results and validate them for biological function.
Our dual-layer platform combines predictive bioinformatics with generative
protein models to create receptor-binding proteins that enable phages to bind
specific bacterial targets, reducing design time from months to hours.

Our solution becomes increasingly scalable through a generative RBP bank—a
library of validated designs that can be recombined for future clinical needs.
In vitro results fine-tune our models, lessening wet lab validation requirements
over time as the AI learns from each successful design.

Academic literature and our interviews with scientists confirmed our AI-driven
phage sequence modification alongside protein interaction validation is a new
arena in synthetic biology especially phage therapy. We aim to be at the forefront
of combining generative AI-powered receptor-binding protein design with wet-lab
validation, enabling rapid custom phage design even when no natural match exists.

### Has the team presented logical product development plans with realistic milestones, timelines, resources, and risks?

#### Structured Timeline and Milestones

Our development follows a systematic 12-year timeline with clearly defined
phases and deliverables. Year 1 focuses on building the alpha AI platform,
securing biobank access, and establishing wet-lab protocols. Year 2 progresses
to beta launch, seed funding, and first customer agreements. By Year 3, we
achieve commercial rollout in compassionate-use countries with regulatory
partnerships in place.

Key milestones include Q1-Q2 Year 1 core AI model training on E. coli phage-host
datasets, Q2-Q3 wet lab pipeline setup, Q3 biobank agreements, and Q4 provisional
patent filing. This progression demonstrates logical sequencing from technical
development through regulatory preparation to market entry.

#### Resource Requirements and Allocation

We have identified comprehensive resource needs including phage-bacteria
interaction datasets from Davidson and Maxwell Labs, cloud GPU access through AWS,
University of Toronto BioZone lab space, and IP strategy support from The Hatchery
accelerator. Our detailed cost structure shows Year 1 upfront costs of approximately
CAD 305,900-328,950, including lab equipment (CAD 8,200), documentation costs (CAD 80,000),
and operational expenses.

#### Financial Projections and Revenue Model

Our hybrid revenue model charges CAD 8,000-15,000 per AI-generated RBP plus 8%
royalties on commercialized phage cocktails. Base case projections show Year 1
net profit of CAD 318,400 from 5 customers, scaling to CAD 11.75M by Year 5.
Breakthrough scenario projections including clinical trials reach CAD 212.50M
by Year 12.

#### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

We systematically identified threats including market resistance to AI-based
therapy, regulatory approval complexity, computational costs, and bacterial
evolution challenges. Our analysis acknowledges limited AI expertise requiring
personnel expansion and potential integration difficulties with existing
clinical workflows.

### Has the team outlined the skills, capabilities, and stakeholders required to be credible in developing their solution further?

#### Core Team Skills and Expansion Plans

Our founding team combines expertise in research development, operation oversight,
business strategy, ethics, finance, and scientific translation. Despite diverse
current expertise, we've identified critical gaps requiring additional talent in
AI and computational biology for further proof of concept development, plus wet-lab
operations for RBP validation and therapeutic testing capacity.

Following anticipated seed funding, we plan strategic personnel expansion across
four key roles: AI Specialists (2 positions at CAD 70K-90K full-time), Operations
Manager/Finance (CAD 60K-80K), Wet-Lab Technicians (4 positions at CAD 45K-60K each),
and Marketing Development Lead (CAD 60K-85K). This hiring plan addresses our
SWOT-identified weakness of limited AI expertise requiring personnel expansion.

#### Critical Academic and Institutional Partnerships

We've secured strategic partnerships with Canada's leading phage research groups
- Davidson Lab and Maxwell Lab at University of Toronto - providing curated datasets,
experimental advice, and scientific credibility. University of Toronto's BioZone
facility provides physical lab space, safety infrastructure, and shared equipment
access. The Hatchery accelerator offers business mentorship, IP strategy support,
and investor connections.

#### Essential Resource Infrastructure

Our technical capabilities require phage-bacteria interaction datasets from
partner labs, cloud GPU access through AWS with future sponsorship plans, BSL-2
wet lab space (CAD 4,000-7,000/month), and advanced protein modeling platforms
including ESM-3 and Boltz-2. We've established IP strategy support through The
Hatchery with plans for specialized legal counsel as we progress toward patent
filings.

Long-term partnership goals include collaboration with established companies
like IPATH, Eligo Biosciences, and Eliava Institute to expedite research workflows
as phage therapy gains pharmaceutical adoption.

### Has the team considered the positive and negative long-term impacts of their fully developed solution?

Our platform addresses antimicrobial resistance projected to cause 10 million
deaths annually by 2050. By reducing phage therapy development from six months
to hours, we democratize access to personalized treatments and transform phage
therapy from last-resort to frontline defense. Our modular RBP bank creates
reusable therapeutic libraries that improve global health equity.

We identified critical challenges including bacterial evolution and resistance
development, making long-term efficacy unpredictable. Regulatory uncertainty
surrounding genetically modified phages creates market barriers. Healthcare
provider resistance to AI-based approaches may slow adoption. High computational
costs ($8,000-$15,000 per therapeutic candidate) could limit accessibility despite
democratization goals. Integration challenges into existing clinical workflows
require substantial training and infrastructure adaptation. Intellectual property
vulnerabilities exist since naturally occurring phages are difficult to patent.
Using artificial intelligence to design genetic codes raises definite concerns
about affecting evolution and potentially contributing to natural selection pressures.
We acknowledge increasing regulatory pressure on AI data collection, utilization, and
generation. Identified risks include bacterial resistance evolution, regulatory
uncertainty for genetically modified phages, high costs, and clinical integration
challenges.

We view artificial intelligence as a neutral tool that can be a public good or
be detrimental for the well being of humanity heavily depending on the intentions.
Given that many industries are transitioning for the better using artificial
intelligence and that antibiotic resistance is an imminent danger for humanity
we consider AI-driven therapeutic development an inevitable advancement to save
millions of lives.

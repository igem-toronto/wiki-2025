title: Human Practices - Introduction

# Overview

As the Human Practices team, we have woven ethical reflection, stakeholder input, and social impact assessment into each phase of Mystiphage’s development. Guided by bioethicists, health economists, patient advocates, and regulatory experts, we have built a framework that prioritizes four key aspects:

1. Transparency in algorithmic design and data use
2. Equitable access to phage libraries and diagnostics
3. Cost-effectiveness to ensure sustainability in diverse healthcare settings
4. Cultural sensitivity in deployment strategies across regions

These guiding principles have shaped our procedure, from AI model validation to community engagement and they ensure that Mystiphage remains scientifically sound while being socially responsible and attuned to real-world needs.

## What Inspired Our Journey
Senior members of the team first encountered antimicrobial resistance and phage therapy back in high school through shadowing researchers at local hospitals. They saw firsthand that despite promising case reports, current phage protocols lack consistency, speed, and standardization. 

That passion was reignited during the 2024 iGEM project cycle, where we were passionate about targeting antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In this year’s cycle, under the mentorship of our advisors Charles and Pramal, we first explored generative protein workflows: designing novel receptor-binding proteins (RBPs) in silico for the same increasingly prevalent AMR issue. The thrill of using AI to reprogram phage specificity sparked the question: what if we could combine phage therapy with next-generation computation to close the gap between patient and availability? This is when Mystiphage was born.


 ## Validating the Problem with Patient Stories

Recognizing that lived experience is our most valuable compass, we started our iGEM journey by having one-on-one conversations with individuals who survived multidrug-resistant infections. Through empathy interviews and narrative mapping, we uncovered critical pain points:

\-   Fear and confusion around novel therapies
    
\-   Need for clear, jargon-free educational materials
    
\-   Desire for patient support communities to share experiences
    

These insights guided our communications and Human Practices strategy. Below is a brief summary of the initial interviews that started off our journey:

## Patient Stories: Humanizing the Problem

At Toronto Western Hospital, we spoke with Sarah, a patient who had been hospitalized twice due to recurring infections. Despite being prescribed antibiotics at least six times in her first year of illness, she found them increasingly ineffective. While she had heard of phage therapy, she viewed it as experimental and unfamiliar. Still, she expressed hope that Mystiphage could make the therapy faster and more accessible, noting that antibiotic resistance felt terrifying and deeply personal.

James had researched phage therapy after reading a news article and was enthusiastic about its precision. He had experienced lingering infections despite multiple antibiotic courses and was frustrated by the lack of alternatives. His doctor had mentioned phage therapy but emphasized its limited availability. James saw Mystiphage’s AI-driven approach as futuristic and promising, and he encouraged further research and deployment.

Maria had endured years of hospitalizations and countless antibiotic prescriptions. She was unfamiliar with phage therapy until a specialist mentioned it, and while she was cautious, she recognized the urgency of finding better solutions. Her experience with resistant infections left her feeling vulnerable and uncertain. She saw Mystiphage as a logical step forward, especially if it could reduce hospital stays and improve outcomes.

Across all interviews, patients expressed deep concern about the growing threat of antibiotic resistance and a shared desire for more effective treatments. Most had never heard of phage therapy or had only encountered it briefly, reinforcing how little public awareness exists. Our stakeholder research confirmed that phage therapy remains on the cusp of mainstream adoption, largely due to slow matching processes and limited infrastructure. This inspired our Human Practices strategy: to build a globally informed, patient-centered pipeline that accelerates access, improves education, and ensures Mystiphage reaches those who need it most.

# Acknowledgments

With our Human Practices section coming to a close, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude to the Maxwell Lab for their mentorship in phage purification, the Davidson Lab for their expertise in bacterial resistance assays, and the KimLab for their insights into receptor-binding protein engineering. We would also like to thank the founder of Fable Therapeutics for sharing invaluable lessons on translating phage innovation to market, and the Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research for access to world-class facilities. Support from BioZone and the Institute of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Toronto enabled the development of our hardware prototypes, while the Engineering Society provided essential funding and collaborative space that strengthened our team. Each of these partners have all been instrumental in transforming Mystiphage from an idea into a tangible force for scientific and societal progress, paving the way for a new era of precision biologics and global antimicrobial resilience.

# Conclusion

Looking ahead, Mystiphage aims to redefine the standard of care in phage therapy, delivering faster and more accessible treatments for those battling resistant infections. By uniting breakthrough science, ethical innovation, and strategic execution, we are paving the way for phage therapeutics to become a cornerstone of modern medicine. Our mission is clear: we are dedicated to building a future where every patient facing a multidrug-resistant infection can benefit from the precision and promise of Mystiphage.

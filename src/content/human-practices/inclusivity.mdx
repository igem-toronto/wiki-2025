# Commitment to Inclusivity

Throughout our work timeline, the Mystiphage team is committed to building an inclusive research environment that values and integrates diverse perspectives at every stage of our project. We recognize that addressing complex global challenges, like antimicrobial resistance, requires input from individuals across different disciplines, cultures, and lived experiences. To that end, we have intentionally broadened our outreach to international partners, engaged a wide spectrum of stakeholders from academia, industry, law, and patient advocacy, and embedded inclusivity principles into our team recruitment and communication strategies. As a team, we aim not only to enrich our own work but also ensure that the benefits of Mystiphage are responsive to communities around the world.

## Global Outreach Efforts

From the outset, our team recognized that antimicrobial resistance as well as phage therapy are global challenges demanding input from diverse geographic and cultural perspectives. To that end, we tackled stakeholder engagement in India, broader Asia, Europe, and Canadian Indigenous communities. These discussions not only refined our selection of RBP targets and delivery strategies but also forged enduring networks for knowledge exchange beyond the iGEM season.

## Holistic Stakeholder Engagement

True inclusivity means engaging every voice that intersects with our technology, from legal and commercial frameworks to patient and ecological considerations. We reached out to university professors in microbiology, intellectual property lawyers specializing in biotech patents, co-founders of start-ups working on phage formulations, clinical infectious disease specialists, and representatives from patient advocacy groups. Each stakeholder offered unique guidance: patent attorneys helped us navigate licensing pathways, industry mentors advised on scalable manufacturing, and patient advocates underscored the importance of clear, compassionate communication. By weaving these diverse perspectives into our decision-making, we built a well-rounded project roadmap that anticipates challenges and maximizes societal benefit.

## Inclusive Team Composition

Our commitment to inclusion also extended *inward* to the way we formed our iGEM Toronto Mystiphage team. We sought members from a wide array of academic disciplines: molecular biology, neuroscience, ethics, computer science, and economics to ensure that every aspect of the project benefited from varied skill sets and worldviews. We actively recruited students from underrepresented backgrounds, offered flexible meeting times for those with caregiving or work commitments, and provided a structured leadership system so newcomers could learn from experienced teammates. This approach fostered a collaborative environment in which everyone felt empowered to contribute their ideas and expertise.

## Nurturing an Inclusive Laboratory Culture

Beyond outreach and communication, we cultivated an inclusive culture within our lab and virtual workspaces. At the start of the iGEM season, all team members reviewed and agreed to a code of conduct emphasizing respect and open dialogue. Regular “team check-ins” - short, anonymous surveys - allowed us to identify any interpersonal or logistical barriers and address them promptly. By prioritizing psychological safety, we ensured that all voices could be heard, from the first-year undergraduates to students completing their master's program.

## Community Partnerships and Educational Outreach

Inclusivity also means sharing our passion and expertise beyond academia. We collaborated with local high schools in Toronto to host hands-on bacteria discovery workshops, providing lab tours that demystify synthetic biology. Our team members also volunteered at University of Toronto’s orientation, educating new students about the project and the widely underrepresented solution of phage therapy. Through these grassroots efforts, we hoped to inspire the next generation of scientists and reinforced our belief that inclusivity is both a moral imperative and the engine of innovation.

# Wiki & Web
## Overview
The wiki team built the wiki platform you are currently on. While in past years,
the wiki was based on the Flask template with some customizations, we rebuilt
the platform from scratch using the Astro framework. This allows us to
seamlessly integrate Markdown and MDX content, making it easier to create and
manage pages.

## Features
- **Markdown & MDX Support**: Write content in Markdown or MDX, allowing for
  easy formatting and embedding of React components.
- **References**: Automatic management of references and citations using
  BibTeX files and custom remark plugins.

## Environment Setup
Instead of working primarily on the gitlab instance, we set up a a staging repository
on GitHub. This allows us to use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and
deployment there. The wiki is hosted in this staging setup on GitHub Pages, right
alongside our club website and the wikis from past years.

## Writing Process
We have explored different ways to include the whole team in writing for the wiki.
This year, the wiki team creatd training videos and resources to show members how
to use markdown to write and edit wiki articles. These were written outside of the
repository and then added in by wiki team members through pull requests.

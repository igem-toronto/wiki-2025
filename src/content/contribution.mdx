# Contribution
In 2025, iGEM Toronto delivered MystiPhage, an integrated, generative
AI-powered platform designed to accelerate personalized phage therapy
against antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Our contributions combine
computational innovation, experimental validation, prototype delivery,
bioethical and sociopolitical assessment,  targeted commercialisation
strategy and community-facing resources, all of which is intended to be
reusable by future iGEM teams and researchers. Our key insights are below:

## Dry Lab
Our Drylab team developed PHORAGE, an open-source generative AI model that
accelerates phage matching by designing optimized receptor-binding proteins
(RBPs) for targeted bacterial infections, reducing the process from months to
under 24 hours. Central to this system is our generative phage bank, which is a
curated dataset of validated RBP sequences and structures that enables iterative
AI-driven optimization using ESM3-based hallucination, Boltz2 co-folding with
the target bacterial receptor, and MCMC refinement. All associated datasets,
modeling scripts, and validation protocols are publicly available on our GitLab,
empowering future iGEM teams and researchers to rapidly generate novel phage
binders and advance the development of scalable, personalized phage therapies
against antimicrobial resistance.

## Wet Lab
Our Wetlab team implemented a rapid DBTL cycle to validate receptor-binding
proteins (RBPs) generated by PHORAGE experimentally. Engineered RBPs were
cloned into plasmid backbones containing homology arms to replace wild-type
RBPs in prophage-containing E. coli. A CRISPR–Cas counterselection plasmid
ensured elimination of unmodified phages, allowing precise assessment of RBP
functionality. Engineered phages will be tested through phage spotting assays,
and results fed back to refine the dry lab generative models. All protocols,
construct maps, and assay data are openly available on our Experiments page,
providing future iGEM teams with a validated, reproducible framework for
integrating computationally designed RBPs with experimental phage engineering.

## Hardware
Our hardware team developed a prototype electroceutical phage pill designed
to deliver AI-generated phages directly to the human or animal gut, a critical
reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes. The pill features an enteric coating
to survive stomach acid and a conditional release system triggered by bacterial
biomarkers, such as hydrogen gas. Two release mechanisms, an electromagnetic cap
and a nichrome-fusible thread, were iteratively tested and optimized for reliable
payload deployment. All design files, including but not limited to PCB schematics,
sensor calibration data, and CAD mockups, are available on our Hardware page,
offering future iGEM teams a modular, adaptable framework for developing targeted
therapeutic delivery systems in synthetic biology applications.

## Entrepreneurship
We advanced MystiPhage from concept to venture-ready platform through a
combination of market analysis, business modeling, and strategic partnerships.
The team assessed the global antimicrobial resistance (AMR) market, identifying
unmet needs in clinical phage labs and research hospitals, and developed a B2B
business model delivering AI-generated, lab-validated RBPs on demand. Revenue
streams include personalized phage sales and royalty agreements from RBP
cocktails. Participation in the University of Toronto Hatchery incubator’s NEST
program enabled the team to create investor-ready pitches, cash flow projections,
and a 10-year funding roadmap. All frameworks, templates, and lessons learned are
openly documented to guide future iGEM teams pursuing entrepreneurial applications.

## Human Practices
Our Human Practices team conducted over 60 stakeholder interviews across 5
countries and 4 hospitals, engaging patients, caregivers, microbiologists,
computational biologists, and regulatory professionals. Feedback was integrated
into every technical division, informing RBP design, wet lab workflows, and hardware
development. Public engagement initiatives included surveys, educational workshops,
newsletters, and accessible animations to address concerns about phage therapy
safety, AI use, and data transparency. Resources, reports, and outreach materials
are fully documented, providing future iGEM teams with a framework for ethical
reflection, stakeholder engagement, and the assessment of social impact.

## Outreach
Our outreach team focused on communications, community engagement, and mentorship.
They managed the team’s social media presence, producing content that highlighted
our research, progress, and educational initiatives. The team also created the
promotional video and the presentation video to communicate Mystiphage’s objectives
and results to both the iGEM community and the public. Additionally, they organized
the iGEM Mentorship Program, connecting graduate and professional mentors with
undergraduate students to provide guidance and skill development. All materials,
program frameworks, and social media strategies are openly documented, offering
future iGEM teams resources for effective engagement and mentorship initiatives.

## Wiki
Our wiki team designed and developed an accessible, user-friendly online platform
to showcase MystiPhage’s research, methodologies, and findings. The team focused on
creating a visually appealing layout, ensuring easy navigation, and integrating
interactive elements to enhance user engagement. They collaborated closely with all
other divisions to accurately represent their work and ensure the content was both
informative and engaging.

## PHORAGER Computational Pipeline

PHORAGER is a fully automated, open-source software pipeline that engineers bacteriophage receptor-binding proteins through AI-driven design and physics-based validation. The modular architecture integrates state-of-the-art foundation models with statistical optimization to reprogram phage host specificity.

### Core Software Components

**Generative Design Module** (`mcmc/`)

-   ESM3 protein language model for novel RBD sequence generation
-   Boltz-2 biomolecular foundation model for structure prediction and binding affinity estimation
-   Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling with simulated annealing for iterative optimization

**Data Curation Pipeline** (`scripts/`)

-   Automated annotation of bacterial glycan receptors (LPS outer core types) using LPSTyper and BLAST
-   Protein receptor identification via DIAMOND high-throughput sequence alignment
-   RBP sequence collection through HMM-based iterative searches and CD-HIT clustering

**Physics-Based Validation** (`docking/`)

-   HADDOCK3 modular docking framework for protein-glycan interactions
-   Latin hypercube sampling for systematic parameter optimization
-   Automated scoring and clustering of binding poses

**Routing System** (`scripts/routing_script.py`)

-   Intelligent phage bank query interface with sequence similarity assessment
-   Automated decision logic for retrieving pre-validated phages vs. initiating de novo design
-   Batch processing capabilities for clinical-scale throughput
